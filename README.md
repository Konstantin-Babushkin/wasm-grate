# WASM-grate
WASM-grate (a portmanteau of WebAssembly and "integrate/migrate") is a tool designed to streamline the adoption of WebAssembly in modern front-end web projects.

It helps you to identify potential bottlenecks or performance hitches in JavaScript (JS) or TypeScript (TS) codebases. WASM-grate highlights areas that could significantly benefit from the speed and efficiency of WebAssembly (e.g. CPU-intensive tasks).

## Current state
WASM-grate is still in development and not production-ready yet.

**Please, wait for version 1.0.0**
